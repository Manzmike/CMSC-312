Review the programs (spock.c and kirk.c). 
Answer (or discuss) questions listed below: 
a) Discuss and evaluate what happens when you're running both in separate 
windows and you kill one or the other.     (3)
When you end up running both spock.c and kirk.c in two diffrent windows it happens that
they end up working well. When a message is went a message is outputted. In the apsect of
killing one nothing happens. The reason because of this is because kirk.c is a message queue
where a message is sent it waits till it can be dispursed. 


b) Discuss what happens (and why) when you run two copies of kirk. (3) 
When two copies of kirk run it ends up happening that there is no data being 
subcriped towards and/or published to the output screen. 
The reason why this is happening is because with kirk it is missing a outreach 
of subscribed data. It sends this data to a message queue where to data is waiting
to be dispursed to the spock/ 



c) Discuss what happens (and why) when your run two copies of spock.(3)
When two itterations of spock are running nothing happens. In the situation 
of the the spock it needs a the file of kirk.c to be subcribed to to output data.
